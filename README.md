# Hackaddiction Maze

This code is an infinite maze that YOU have to try and escape. You don't know how you got here, you don't know if you'll make it out. 
At first, not all is as it seems. You have to find your way out of an extremely large maze using skill and speed. This maze is like no other, for it is
exceedingly large and seemingly infinite. 

DIRECTIONS:
Use the keys W,A,S,D to move throughout the maze. The maze is infinite, there is no exit on any side as it is hidden deep within the maze. As you cross the
boundary of the maze, the maze will shift to another section of the maze. 
























*** HINT ***
If you’re having trouble finding the exit, just remember “X marks the spot”.
